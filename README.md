# UBC API
## What it does:
Beautifies the lacking unofficial UBC transcript with extra information and better formatting.

### Siang's Modification
The API server [ubc-api.herokuapp.com](https://ubc-api.herokuapp.com) appears to be down. This is a quickfix to use the data/sources.json file for the course names.

## How it does this:
It does this in several ways:
1. Adding a course names columns
2. Removing unnecessary widgets
3. Spacing items out better and increasing the width of the table 
4. Allow you to manually edit course names
5. Optionally allow you to remove unnecessary columns + rows

## Instructions

1. There's a link on [**this page**](http://arashout.site/posts/improved-ubc-transcript) that you should drag onto your bookmarks bar

2. Go to your [**Grades Summary**](https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/sscportal/servlets/SRVSSCFramework?function=SessGradeRpt) page.

3. Click the bookmark link to run!

## Output

The code gets rid of the extra tabs/average calculator app, spaces things out a little better, and aligns the table to the header.

This is what the transcript looked like before

## How it works:
This application is split into 2 parts the [the bookmarklet](#Bookmarklet) and [the server](#The Server)

### Bookmarklet

### The Server

## Credits:
- [crclayton](https://github.com/crclayton) originally created the bookmarklet that formatted the transcript, I'm simply building off of it.
